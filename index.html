						The Burroughs Wellcome Fund is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences by supporting research as well as scientific and educational activities. This fund has support APSA’s Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Working Group (PST-DWG) in creating the Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit on June 21-22, 2019 in Durham, NC.<br><br>The Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit will be comprised of 50-60 stakeholders, like yourself, who are experienced in addressing barriers to physician scientists careers or are undergoing physician scientist training. Our major goal from this summit is to utilize <a href="https://carey.jhu.edu/uploads/executive_education/design-thinking-infographic-full.png?v=1530287571">Human-Centered Design Thinking Sessions</a> as a mechanism for developing a strategic plan, coordinating a research study to address questions related to physician scientist diversity, and to codify outcomes from our discussion for publication.<br><br>This summit will not only give APSA an opportunity to convene its stakeholders and discuss the important topic of diversity in the physician scientist community, but also enable individuals from diverse backgrounds to support one another across various stages of training.

					Dr. Gotian has taken on her current roles after nearly 22 years (and two perfect scores on NIH training grants) of running the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, a partnership between Weill Cornell, Rockefeller University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Dr. Gotian considers herself a lifelong learner. She is an alumna of Teachers College Columbia University where she studied Adult Learning and Leadership and focused her research on what makes physician-scientists successful. She received her BS and MS in Business Management from the University at Stony Brook in New York as well as certificates in Executive Leadership and Managing for Execution from Cornell University. Dr. Gotian publishes in both medical education and adult learning journals on topics ranging from diversity and inclusion in academic medicine to virtual mentoring. She also has a new book on medical education coming out in the fall, with one chapter devoted to the voice of the students, something she is immensely proud of. As one of the few people in the country who studies adult learning within academic medicine, Dr. Gotian has given many talks and workshops at the NIH, AAMC and UNCF.
